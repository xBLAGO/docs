# BLAGO: A Decentralized Protocol for a World of Value

## Our Mission

We are building a new economic and social model based on trust, value, and mutual support. BLAGO is a DePIN (Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Network) where the infrastructure is not servers, but a network of trust between verified human beings.

Our goal is to create a system where anyone can have their real-world needs met, funded by a global community that believes in their mission, and where reputation (`GOOD`) is the most valuable asset.

## Core Principles

*   **Proof-of-Personhood:** Every key participant is a verified human, leveraging technologies like World ID.
*   **Decentralized Economy:** Built on the Solana blockchain for speed, security, and scalability.
*   **Real-World Value:** The system allows tokenizing real-world assets (`ASSET_NFT`) and financing real-world needs (`NEED_NFT`).
*   **Open & Transparent:** Our code, governance, and operations are open to the community.

## Join Us

This is just the beginning. We are looking for developers, visionaries, and believers to help us build this new world.

**The world changes with every act of good. Let's build it together.**
